Usage: accent.py [OPTION] --hazard=HAZARD_FILE --exposure=EXP_FILE --extent=XMIN,YMIN,XMAX,YMAX FILE

Arguments:
    FILE                    Output path for the impact layer and associated products.  If omitted,
                            the impact layer will be written into the current working directory.
    --hazard=HAZARD_FILE    Hazard layer file such as a shapefile or tif containing flood, tsunami,
                            volcano, earthquake data. The layer should be accompanied with an appropriate
                            keywords file.
    --exposure=EXP_FILE     Exposure layer file such as a shapefile or tif containing population,
                            structures (e.g. buildings), roads, etc. data. The layer should be accompanied with
                            an appropriate keywords file.

    --template=TEMPLATE     QGIS .qpt template file to be used for generating the PDF report.
                            If ommitted, no PDF will be generated. PDF output file will follow prefix rules (see below).
Options:
    --extent=XMIN,YMIN,
             XMAX,YMAX      a quartet of decimal degrees values representing the analysis extent that
                            should be used. The order of the values is significant, representing XMIN, YMIN,
                            XMAX, YMAX. This option is optional - if omitted the union of the hazard and
                            exposure layer extents should be used.
    --aggregation=AG_FILE   path to an aggregation layer such as a shapefile or tif containing village,
                            boundaries, town subdivisions etc. data. The layer should be accompanied with
                            an appropriate keywords file.

-p --prefix : prefix for the impact layer and associated products. This option is optional
        - if omitted, a randomly generated letter sequence will be used that is
        guaranteed to be unique.
-v --version : print the current version of InaSAFE and exit.
-l --list : list the available impact functions and exit. Can be used along with -e and -h
        options to produce a filtered list of Impact Functions that will work with the
        specified hazard and exposure layers.
-d --download : must be used in tandem with -e. You can also use the -o and -p options
        but in this context the prefix and path will be used for the downloaded shapefiles.
        The download option will download all road, building polygons and building points
        for the defined extents from the InaSAFE OpenStreetMap download service.
